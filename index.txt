About me

Hello! I’m Faizan Masood, a passionate Frontend Developer in Pakistan and a skilled Software Engineer with a strong focus on creating responsive, optimized, and fast-loading websites. I recently completed a 6-month internship where I worked on real-world projects, gaining hands-on experience in building high-quality web applications.

I specialize in modern frontend technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Tailwind CSS, and Next.js. My expertise lies in delivering custom website designs that are visually appealing and user-friendly, optimized for performance across all devices.

I chose frontend development because I’m passionate about improving the web experience by crafting intuitive and accessible interfaces. Whether you're a business or a startup, I can help you build responsive web applications that stand out.

Known for being detail-oriented, creative, and a fast learner, I’m eager to take on new challenges and contribute to meaningful projects. If you're looking for a freelance frontend developer to bring your ideas to life, let’s connect!
